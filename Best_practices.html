              <h3>Best Practices</h3>
              <p>
                Many threats exist in the cyber-space today and more often than
                not, the areas we overlook may make us victims. The following
                sections briefly summarize how to safely navigate the web and
                how to prepare yourself for a potential breach of information.
              </p>
              <h5>Passwords</h5>
              <p>
                Password safety is a very rudimentary step in the world of
                computers today. When creating a password, a user who can make a
                password they can easily remember may not always be the safest.
                Passwords should be sophisticated and reasonably lengthy. A rule
                of thumb for passwords is to make them long. The Cybersecurity &
                Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) recommends using atleast
                16 characters for password creation. In addition to using
                sophisticated and long passwords, CISA recommends using a
                password manager to keep track and secure this information.
              </p>

                CISA.gov published a video for best practices on their

                to guide everyday users with their recommendations on this
                topic.
              </p>
              <h5>Software Updates</h5>
              <p>
                Growing up in the 2000s-2010s, I can remember a time when
                Windows Defender was known for being a mediocre form of
                protection out-of-the-box for Windows XP users. Thankfully,
                times have changed and proprietary OS security features now hold
                their own weight. Security updates are a necessity for staying
                secure today, even if you use 3rd party security and antivirus
                software. Keeping your Operating System and software up-to-date
                is critical for preventing potentially dangerous exploits
                occurring on your devices. This does not only apply to
                computers, as cellphones nearly mirror the functions of a
                computer today, they should also be up to date. While I cannot
                assume what OS or device you use, ensuring you are using the
                most recent version of your required software is paramount in
                today's dynamic world of threats.
              </p>
              <h5>Phishing</h5>
              <p>
                Phishing is a social engineering method of deceiving a person
                that the representation of something is the real thing. It's
                fraud for the digital space. In today's age, phishing is used to
                obtain credentials, personal information, financial data, and so
                on. This may come in the form of an email, text, social media,
                and anywhere where you can be communicated to. The simplest way
                to avoid being 'phished' is to identify possible hints of any
                strange nature. Phishing is not restricted to personal use.
                Phishing occurs in the work space and may compromise a larger
                network if security procedures are lacking. The below screenshot
                is an example of a phishing email of the government requesting
                money with obvious signs of deception.
              </p>
              <div class="main">
                <div class="card" style="width: 100%">
                  <img
                    class="card-img"
                    src="https://cdn.glitch.global/a0092f56-ae43-48a0-9e32-278c3e223e4e/PhishingExample.png?v=1742538685615"
                    alt="Phishing Example"
                    style="width: 50%; margin: 0 auto; border: 4px solid black"
                  />
                </div>
                <p>
                  The most obvious indicator of this being a phishing attempt is
                  that this was caught by the Gmail platform as spam and
                  indicated as such. In a scenario where this email may be real
                  (false-positive), the indicators of it being a phishing
                  attempt are still very clear. There's no reason that U.S.
                  Homeland security would contact someone on a personal email,
                  from a Gmail account, and as Blind-Courtesy Copy. The name of
                  the person does not reflect the Gmail sender's email, or the
                  other Gmail contact at the bottom of the message. The user is
                  requesting money via Western Union or Money Gram, and is
                  stating that the current president is Joe Biden, when that is
                  not the case at the time of receiving this email. The entire
                  email is in caps and is not formatted appropriately to believe
                  that this is a real government email.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This email does not have any links to open, which is also a
                  method to lure users into either giving up credentials on a
                  fake website, or accessing a website with malicious software
                  embedded. While people may get deceived by more intricately
                  made emails, it is important to scan an email before
                  interacting with it, and prevent one's self from becoming a
                  victim.

              <h3>Antivirus Software</h3>
              <p>
                Antivirus Software is an essential form of software, especially
                for users who have reason to browse a lot on the web, or have a
                lot of crucial information to keep secure on their device.
                Antivirus software is especially useful for preventing
                potentially malicious software from being accessed, but it is
                even more useful when an infection has compromised your system.
                This safeguard is comparable to getting a vaccine, but for your
                devices. There are plenty of reputable Antivirus companies that
                exist who make great products. I recommend doing the research to
                establish your needs and be informed to make that small
                investment.
              </p>
              <h4>Firewalls</h4>
              <p>
                Firewalls in short, prevent certain traffic from the web to
                access your system. With all types of data containing many
                identifiers and port numbers, you can set up a firewall with
                either the features that come with your OS (such as Windows) or
                with software you can obtain such as an antivirus or
                firewall-specific software. This software-firewall is the most
                convenient form of firewall to most users at home. Enterprise
                networks and confidential systems may use a physical-firewall
                that can prevent more traffic or even perform more sophisticated
                tasks beyond the scope of this section. In a nutshell, your
                firewall will act as a filter and reject potentially unwanted
                traffic, it is recommended that you becomes familiar with
                setting up a firewall and understand its capabilities.

              <h3>Best Practices</h3>
              <p>
                Many threats exist in the cyber-space today and more often than not, the areas we overlook may make us victims.
                The following sections briefly summarize how to safely navigate the web and how to prepare yourself for a 
                potential breach of information.
              </p>
              <h5>Passwords</h5>
              <p>
                Password safety is a very rudimentary step in the world of computers today. When creating a password, a user who
                can make a password they can easily remember may not always be the safest. Passwords should be sophisticated and
                reasonably lengthy. A rule of thumb for passwords is to make them long. The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure
                Security Agency (CISA) recommends using atleast 16 characters for password creation. In addition to using
                sophisticated and long passwords, CISA recommends using a password manager to keep track and secure this
                information. 
              </p>
              <p>
                CISA.gov published a video for best practices on their <a href="https://www.cisa.gov/secure-our-world/use-strong-passwords">
                website</a> to guide everyday users with their recommendations
                on this topic.
              </p>
              <h5>Software Updates</h5>
              <p>
                Growing up in the 2000s-2010s, I can remember a time when Windows Defender was known for being a mediocre form of protection
                out-of-the-box for Windows XP users. Thankfully, times have changed and proprietary OS security features now hold their own weight.
                Security updates are a necessity for staying secure today, even if you use 3rd party security and antivirus software. Keeping your 
                Operating System and software up-to-date is critical for preventing potentially dangerous exploits occurring on your devices.
                This does not only apply to computers, as cellphones nearly mirror the functions of a computer today, they should also be up to date.
                While I cannot assume what OS or device you use, ensuring you are using the most recent version of your required software is
                paramount in today's dynamic world of threats.

              <h5>
                Phishing
              </h5>
              <p>
                Phishing is a social engineering method of deceiving a person that the representation of something is the real thing. It's fraud for the digital space. 
                In today's age, phishing is used to obtain credentials, personal information, financial data, and so on. This may come in the form of an email, text, 
                social media, and anywhere where you can be communicated to. The simplest way to avoid being 'phished' is to identify possible hints of any strange nature.
                Phishing is not restricted to personal use. Phishing occurs in the work space and may compromise a larger network if security procedures are lacking.
                The below screenshot is an example of a phishing email of the government requesting money with obvious signs of deception.
              </p>
              <div class="main">
          <div class="card" style="width: 100%">
            <img
              class="card-img"
              src="https://cdn.glitch.global/a0092f56-ae43-48a0-9e32-278c3e223e4e/PhishingExample.png?v=1742538685615"
              alt="Phishing Example"   
              style="width: 50%; margin: 0 auto; border: 4px solid black;"
              
            />
          </div>
            <p>
              The most obvious indicator of this being a phishing attempt is that this was caught by the Gmail platform as spam and indicated as such. In a scenario where
              this email may be real, the indicators of it being a phishing attempt are very clear. There's no reason that U.S. Homeland security would contact someone on a personal
              email, from a Gmail account, and as Blind-Courtesy Copy. The name of the person does not reflect the Gmail sender's email, or the other Gmail contact at the bottom 
              of the message. The user is requesting money via Western Union or Money Gram, and is stating that the current president is Joe Biden, when that is not the case at the time of receiving
              this email. The entire email is in caps and is not formatted appropriately to believe that this is a real government email. 
            </p>
            <p>
              This email does not have any links to open, which is also a method to lure users into either giving up credentials on a fake website, or accessing a website with malicious
              software embedded. While people may get deceived by more intricately made emails, it is important to scan an email before interacting with it, and prevent one's self 
              from becoming a victim.

              <h3>Antivirus Software</h3>
              <p>
                Antivirus Software is an essential form of software, especially for users who have reason to browse a lot on the web, or have a lot of crucial information 
                to keep secure on their device. Antivirus software is especially useful for preventing potentially malicious software from being accessed, but it is even more useful
                when an infection has compromised your system. This safeguard is comparable to getting a vaccine, but for your devices. There are plenty of reputable Antivirus
                companies that exist who make great products. I recommend doing the research to establish your needs and be informed to make that small investment.
              </p>
              <h4>
                Firewalls
              </h4>
              <p>
                Firewalls in short, prevent certain traffic from the web to access your system. With all types of data containing many identifiers and port numbers, you can set up a firewall with 
                either the features that come with your OS (such as Windows) or with software you can obtain such as an antivirus. This software-firewall is the most convenient form of
                firewall to most users at home. Enterprise networks and confidential systems may use a physical-firewall that can prevent more traffic or even perform more sophisticated
                tasks beyond the scope of this section. In a nutshell, your firewall will act as a filter and reject potentially unwanted traffic.

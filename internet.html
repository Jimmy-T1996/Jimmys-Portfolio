              The internet is a general term to describe the complex web of connections between
              our computers today. Beginning as the ARPANET research project between a few
              universities in the United States, we now have connections that span continents just to exchange
              information with one another. With a complex network to work with, standards have been created
              to ensure all computers can understand each other.

              <h3>Encoding, Binary, and ASCII</h3>
            <p>
              Encoding is the translation of how we communicate, into how computers 
              communicate. Computers send and receive data using a binary system that has
              "on" and "off" values. The values that a computer can use to understand this 
              is through 1's and 0's. For each of these values, this is one "bit".
            </p>
            <p>
              Using logical systems of the powers of 2, a computer can "add up" 1's and 0's
              to reflect a value that can't be immediately understood with standard languages
              that humans use. This standard is the foundation for information exchanges in computers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Starting from the right (from a human standpoint), 2^0 has a bit value of either 1 or 0. Continuing in a 
              'left-wards' direction, the power-value increases by one for every bit that is 
              needed to present a specific piece of information. The value of “5” is displayed as “0101”.

          </div>
          </div>
            <p>
              With larger pieces of data, bits become bytes. 8 bits become a byte with a maximum numerical value 
              of 255. Larger values require more bits and bytes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Binary translates into base 10 values (standard counting) thanks to the totals derived from the powers
              of 2. The numerical values in base 10 can be used to identify the characters listed in the 
              American Standard Code for Information Exchange. Below is a screenshot of table created by the developers
              of ascii-code.com. Notice that on the far left, a different base 10 value reflects another character in the English
              Alphabet.

                This example demonstrates how information starts of as only two values ("on" or "off") and then builds on itself into other
                information. With networks, the packets that are sent to different computers contain information that "plugs in" to the other
                device's software using protocols(logical) and ports(physical).

                <h4>Networks</h4>
                <p>
                  A network is the physical and logical topology of connected devices.
                  In short, two devices that are connected via cable or wirelessly, and
                  transmit/receive data to each other is a network. The internet is a conglomerate of
                  networks around the world and the vastness of it is why it might also be
                  called, the 'web'.
                </p>
               <h4>Physical Connections</h4>
                <p>
                 The connections that connect computers include, copper cable(such as twisted-pair cable), fiber-optic cable(glass strand cable), and even wireless communications
                  (radio frequency). In general, all connections are referred as a medium. Any computer on a network needs a medium to communicate with others and a carrier/Internet
                  Service Provider (ISP) manages the traffic that flows through their infrastructure. This flow control is essential in ensuring that the network(s) are efficiently 
                  implemented.

          Logical Aspect of the Internet
        </h2>
        <h4>Protocols</h4>
                <p>
                  Protocols are rules for how data behaves on a computer when it is sent and delivered. With an endless amount of configurations for 
                  computers(physical and logical), protocols are used to standardize how the data between the computers is exchanged. An example of this
                  is HTTPS (which this website uses). HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol and is used as the standard for browsing the internet. 
                  Web page requests are made with a users sending a request via HTTP to the end devices that has the information requested. A response
                  is then sent to the original sending device with the requested data. The user is then presented with the website (like you seeing this website).
                  The 'S' in HTTPS is a newer standard from the original HTTP protocol and stands for "Secure". This was created to move away from plaintext 
                  communication over the web as cybersecurity is becoming more prevelant with the amount of cybercrime that exists today.
                </p>
              <p>
                There are many protocols that exist for different purposes such as File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Transfer Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), 
                Domain Name Service (DNS), and so on. This ensures that regardless of OS and computer, there is a standard being followed between computers interacting
                on the internet.
              </p>
             
              <h4>Packet Switching</h4>
                <p>
                  Packet switching is the breakdown of larger pieces of data, which is then sent in pieces (packets) over the network to be reassembled on the receiving end. 
                  This is possible with the Open Systems Interconnections (OSI) model. Starting at the Application layer (Layer 7), data is broken down through the different layers
                  until it is sent out via the Physical layer (Layer 1). The receiving computer processes the information in reverse (starting at Layer 1/Physical layer) and is then
                  processed through the different layers until it reaches the Apllication layer (layer 7).
              </p>
              <p>
                In a network, the packets sent and received have source, destination, and sequence (order of packet) to compile the information into a usable format. Larger pieces
                of data, require more packets. This is derived from the ARPANET project before it became the internet.
              </p> 
              <h4>Routing</h4>
                <p>
                  Routing involves the communication of different networks through routers. All networks require a gateway IP address as this is the identifier for how a user receives information
                  on a global topology, and this is on the router being used on an individual's personal network. A person on a LAN at home, sends traffic out of their computeer, which is then passed through their router. 
                  This is what connects them to the web. The internet consists of routers and packets ping to other routers in the most efficient path to reach it's destination. It's possible that the shortest path is 
                  not the most efficient route for a packet to travel, and it is also possible the same path used to send information may not be the same path to receive information. 
                </p>

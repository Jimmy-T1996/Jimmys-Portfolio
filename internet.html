              The internet is a general term to describe the complex web of connections between
              our computers today. Beginning as the ARPANET research project between a few
              universities in the United States, we now have connections that span continents just to exchange
              information with one another. With a complex network to work with, standards have been created
              to ensure all computers can understand each other.

              <h3>Encoding, Binary, and ASCII</h3>
            <p>
              Encoding is the translation of how we communicate into how computers 
              communicate. Computers send and receive data using a binary system that has
              "on" and "off" values. The values that a computer can use to understand this 
              is through 1's and 0's. For each of these values, this is one "bit".
            </p>
            <p>
              Using logical systems of the powers of 2, a computer can "add up" 1's and 0's
              to reflect a value that can't be immediately understood with standard languages
              that humans use.
            </p>
            <p>
              Starting from the right (from a human standpoint), 2^0 has a bit value of either 1 or 0. Continuing in a 
              'left-wards' direction, the power-value increases by one for every bit that is 
              needed to present a specific piece of information. The value of “5” is displayed as “0101”.
            </p>
            <!-- Insert Excel image here -->
            <p>
              With larger pieces of data, bits become bytes. 8 bits become a byte with a maximum numerical value 
              of 255. Larger values require more bits and bytes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Binary translates into base 10 values (standard counting) thanks to the totals derived from the powers
              of 2. This in turn can be used to reflect the characters used in the ASCII chart.

                <h4>Networks</h4>
                <p>
                  A network is the physical and logical topology of connected devices.
                  In short, two devices that are connected via cable or wirelessly, and
                  transmit/receive data to each other is a network. The internet is a conglomerate of
                  networks around the world and the vastness of it is why it might also be
                  called, the 'web'.

              <h3>Encryption</h3>
              <p>
                Data with no encryption is plaintext data. This data can be read by anyone who sees it.
                Encryption is the “scrambling” or ciphering of data before transmission. In short, the 
                data in a message goes through a calculated process (or algorithm) of turning the information 
                to be sent into an unreadable format. The purpose of this is to protect the information that 
                is being sent from being deciphered by an unauthorized third-party or a bad actor who may 
                capture that information. Decryption is the process of deciphering an encrypted message 
                using a key or set of steps in order to turn the unreadable content into comprehendible 
                information (plaintext to the recipient). In a perfect scenario, the intended recipient is 
                the only holder of the key.
              </p>
              <h5>Symmetric Encryption</h5>
              <p>
                Symmetric encryption implies that the encryption and decryption method is using the same 
                key or steps to secure messages. The sender and the receiver would be using the same key. 
              </p>
              <h5>Asymmetric Encryption</h5>
              <p>
                Asymmetric encryption implies that the sender uses a public key to encrypt a transmission. 
                The recipient uses a private key (different than the sender’s key) to decrypt the transmission 
                that was sent. The sender’s key being different prevents them from decrypting the key that they 
                sent. With the recipient being the only client that can decrypt the transmission, this makes it 
                very difficult for anyone else to decipher the encryption. 
              </p>
              <h5>The Importance of Encryption</h5>
              <p>
                Compared to the internet that was derived from the ARPANET decades ago, the internet is now used to fulfill 
                services that use personally identifiable information or financial information of millions, if not, 
                billions of people around the world. With all of the exchange of this information, bad actors, hackers, 
                and so on, want to access this information for illicit reasons. In order to prevent this, 
                security measures need to be taken in how this traffic is sent across the web. 
                Encrypting the information being sent to other devices is a measure that helps ensure that not 
                anyone can intercept confidential information and make use of it in any meaningful way. This would 
                be similar to intercepting an envelope from the mail to an important person but not being able to 
                make sense of the message because it’s literally unreadable.

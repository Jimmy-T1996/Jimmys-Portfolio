                The internet is a general term to describe the complex web of
                connections between our computers today. Beginning as the
                ARPANET research project between a few universities in the
                United States, we now have connections that span continents just
                to exchange information with one another. With a complex network
                to work with, standards have been created to ensure all
                computers can understand each other.

              <h3>Encoding, Binary, and ASCII</h3>
              <p>
                Encoding is the translation of how we communicate, into how
                computers communicate. Computers send and receive data using a
                binary system that has "on" and "off" values. The values that a
                computer can use to understand this is through 1's and 0's. For
                each of these values, this is one "bit".
              </p>
              <p>
                Using a logical system of the powers of 2 for every bit, a computer can "add
                up" 1's and 0's to reflect a value that can't be immediately
                understood with standard human language. This
                standard is the foundation for information exchanges in
                computers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Starting from the right (from a human standpoint), 2^0 has a bit
                value of either 1 or 0 (represents "on" or "off"). Continuing in a 'left-wards' direction,
                the power-value of 2 increases by one number. So this means the more left we go, we will see
                2^1 which is 2, and then 2^2 which is 4, and so on. For every bit that is needed to
                present a specific piece of information, the total 'base 10' number is derived from the "on" bits (1s) and gives us
                a regular number. The value of “5” is displayed as “00000101”. The below table shows how this 
                adds up to a base 10 value of 5.
              </p>

              </div>
              <p>
                With larger pieces of data, bits become bytes. 8 bits become a
                byte with a maximum numerical value of 255. Larger values
                require more bits and bytes. When looking into networking concepts,
                you will learn the an 32-bit IPV4 address such as 255.255.255.255,
                follows this concept exactly. With every period to seperate 8 bits
                of information, you have the possibility of assigning a number to 
                represent a computer's address. Ther are over 4,294,967,296 possible
                addresses in this application of binary.
              </p>
              <p>
                Binary translates into base 10 values (standard counting) thanks
                to the totals derived from the powers of 2. The numerical values
                in base 10 can be used to identify the characters listed in the
                American Standard Code for Information Exchange (ASCII).  In total, there are 255 
                characters on this table. Any character on this table can be written in binary with just
                8 bits/1 byte.

                can vist their website <a href="https://www.ascii-code.com/">here</a>
                and investigate this topic more in-depth.
                Notice that on the far left, a different base 10 value reflects
                another character in the English Alphabet.

                This example demonstrates how information that starts off as only two
                values (1 or 0 / "on" or "off") and then builds on itself into other
                information. With networks, the packets that are sent to
                different computers contain information that "plugs in" to the
                other device's software using protocols(logical) and
                ports(physical). In the bigger picture, it all comes together.

              <h4>Networks</h4>
              <p>
                A network is the physical and logical topology of connected
                devices. In short, two devices that are connected via cable or
                wirelessly, and transmit/receive data to each other is a
                network. The internet is a conglomerate of networks around the
                world and the vastness of it is why it might also be called, the
                'web'.
              </p>
              <h4>Physical Connections</h4>
              <p>
                The connections that connect computers include, copper
                cable(such as twisted-pair copper cable / electrical pulses), fiber-optic cable(glass
                strand cable / light pulses), and even wireless communications (radio
                frequency). In general, all connections are referred to as a
                'medium'. Any computer on a network needs a medium to communicate
                with others and a carrier/Internet Service Provider (ISP)
                manages the traffic that flows through their infrastructure (physical
                topology). This flow control is essential in ensuring that the network(s)
                are efficiently implemented on geographic scale.

          <h2 class="card-title">Logical Aspect of the Internet</h2>
          <h4>Protocols</h4>
          <p>
            Protocols are rules for how data behaves on a computer when it is
            sent and delivered. With an endless amount of configurations for
            computers(physical and logical), protocols are used to standardize
            how the data between the computers is exchanged. An example of this
            is HTTPS (which this website uses). HTTP stands for Hypertext
            Transfer Protocol and is used as the standard for browsing the
            internet. Web page requests are made with a users sending a request
            via HTTP to the end devices that has the information requested. A
            response is then sent to the original sending device with the
            requested data. The user is then presented with the website (like
            you seeing this website). The 'S' in HTTPS is a newer standard from
            the original Hyper Text Transfer Protocol and stands for "Secure". This was created
            to move away from plaintext communication over the web as
            cybersecurity is becoming more prevelant with the amount of
            threats that exists today.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many protocols that exist for for the different OSI layers such as
            File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Transfer Control Protocol/Internet
            Protocol (TCP/IP), Domain Name Service (DNS), and so on. This
            ensures that regardless of OS and computer, there is a standard
            being followed between computers interacting on the internet.
          </p>

          <h4>Packet Switching</h4>
          <p>
            Packet switching is the breakdown of larger pieces of data, which is
            then sent in pieces (packets) over the network to be reassembled on
            the receiving end. This is possible with the Open Systems
            Interconnections (OSI) model. Starting at the Application layer
            (Layer 7), data is broken down through the different layers until it
            is sent out via the Physical layer (Layer 1). The receiving computer
            processes the information in reverse order (starting at Layer 1/Physical
            layer) and is then processed through the different layers until it
            reaches the Application layer (layer 7). The end-result is a successful
            data exchange.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a network, the packets sent and received have source,
            destination, and sequence order (order of packet) to compile the
            information into a usable format when received. Larger pieces of data, require
            more packets. This is derived from the ARPANET project in 1969 before it
            became the internet 14 years later (1983).
          </p>
          <h4>Routing</h4>
          <p>
            Routing involves the communication of different networks through
            routers. All networks require a gateway IP address as this is the
            identifier for how a user receives information on a global topology,
            and this is on the router being used on an individual's personal
            network. A person on a LAN at home, sends traffic out of their
            computeer, which is then passed through their router. This is what
            connects them to the web. The internet consists of routers and
            packets ping to other routers in the most efficient path to reach
            it's destination. It's possible that the shortest path is not the
            most efficient route for a packet to travel, and it is also possible
            the same path used to send information may not be the same path to
            receive information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Below is a diagram that gives a visual of how sending a file might
            look on a topology. A user sends a file over the internet to a user across the globe.
            The packet must be broken into 2 segments before sending them over the medium. The
            packets (or PDUs in diagram) are sent out to ping different routers in an effort to
            find the most efficient path to the destination. Notice that the packets did not
            take the shortest path. By the time the segments are received, they are compiled again 
            based on their sequence order and the whole file is now usable for the recipient. This
            is an example of packet-switching.

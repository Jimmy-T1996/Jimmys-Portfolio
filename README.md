Hello! This websites is a briefe overview of some of the concepts learned in CS1030-Spring semester.

I made this website using bootstrap, CSS, and a lot of tedious planning. This is my first website
and I'm excited about the progress I've made! 

The site has been tested and works with cellphone users as well as other computers.

As of today, the website consists of 5 HTML files (4 if excluding the navbar.html).

All html files include either media or links to other resources.

All pages use the same body style and dark theme. Bootstrap containers are formatted to be centered.

All images are created by me or are otherwise noted on the page.

‚Üê navbar.html
This is the bootstrap code for the navigation menu 
this will be included on every html page by adding
    <!-- Placeholder for navigation that is in navbar.html-->
    <div id="nav-placeholder"></div>
